        <h1>From Scambaiting Videos to Coding: My Journey</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
        <p>My journey into coding began with a simple yet impactful inspiration—scambaiting videos. Back then, I spent countless hours watching videos of scambaiters who hacked scammers, exposing their malicious schemes. The thrill of using technology to outsmart the bad guys caught my attention, and I found myself deeply motivated to become an ethical hacker one day.</p>

        <h2>The Beginning: Searching for Answers</h2>
        <p>Curious to know how one becomes an ethical hacker, I started searching for tutorials and videos on what programming languages hackers should know. Among all the options, Python stood out to me as a versatile and powerful language that is often associated with ethical hacking. I quickly realized that Python was a gateway to understanding cybersecurity, scripting, and automation—key skills for an aspiring ethical hacker.</p>

        <h2>A False Start on Mobile</h2>
        <p>Back then, I didn’t have a laptop, so I turned to my phone and a website called Python Compiler to get started. I spent some time watching Python tutorial videos, practicing basic concepts, and experimenting with code snippets. However, it didn’t feel quite “official” on my phone, and I eventually quit. It wasn’t until early 2024 that my path took a more structured turn.</p>

        <h2>KMS College and New Opportunities</h2>
        <p>In early 2024, KMS College held a learnership in our town, covering topics that piqued my interest—AI, cybersecurity, and data analytics. I joined the course, hoping to gain more knowledge and hands-on experience in these fields. During the course, I had the chance to speak to one of the teachers about my Python studies, even though I had given up previously. He encouraged me to keep going, highlighting the power of Python and noting that it was still relatively new in our country, South Africa. His words reignited my motivation, and I decided to convince my parents to buy me a laptop to aid my learning journey.</p>

        <h2>A Fresh Start with a New Tool</h2>
        <p>When my laptop finally arrived, I felt more like a “real” coder. I dived back into Python with renewed enthusiasm, and the more I coded, the more I enjoyed it. I purchased an online course from PythonX, a simple app from the Play Store called "Learn Python." It was an affordable option at just R150, yet it provided me with a wealth of knowledge. Along with Python, I started exploring additional areas like MySQL, Tkinter, and HTML/CSS. Today, I have a solid foundation in these technologies and am actively learning JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>A New Passion Emerges</h2>
        <p>Though my main goal remains becoming an ethical hacker one day, I’ve developed a deep love for coding and web development along the way. The more I delve into the world of programming, the more I realize how these skills can complement my aspirations in cybersecurity. I’m excited about the possibilities that coding offers—not just for ethical hacking but also for creating and building my own projects in web development.</p>

        <p>This journey has been a mix of ups and downs, but every challenge has only fueled my passion to keep learning and growing. Python might be the language that started it all, but now, I’m exploring new horizons and discovering the joy of coding along the way.</p>
